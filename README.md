# This repository contains the projects that I completed as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification on FreeCodeCamp. The certification requires the completion of several coding challenges and five projects that test the knowledge of JavaScript and algorithmic problem-solving skills.
Projects

## The following are the projects that I have completed as part of the certification:

    Palindrome Checker: A JavaScript function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

    Roman Numeral Converter: A JavaScript function that converts a given number to its Roman numeral equivalent. The function should return a string that represents the Roman numeral.

    Caesars Cipher: A JavaScript function that encrypts a given string using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The function should shift the letters of the string by a given number of positions in the alphabet.

    Telephone Number Validator: A JavaScript function that validates whether a given string is a valid US phone number. The function should return true if the string is a valid phone number, and false otherwise.

    Factorialize a Number: A JavaScript function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

## Technologies Used

### In these projects, I used the following technologies:

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    Git for version control
    GitHub for collaboration and project management
